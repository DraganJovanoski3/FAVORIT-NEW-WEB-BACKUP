            "title": "TheProcess of Heat Transfer",
            "content": "Air conditioners operating in heating mode (heat pumps) function by transferring heat from the outdoor air into the indoor space. For this, the temperature of the evaporator fins must be lower than the outdoor air temperature, around 7-8 degrees Celsius, so that it can absorb heat from the outdoor air. At that moment, moisture from the air condenses and, due to the low temperature of the fins, immediately turns into frost.",

            "title": "Moisture Accumulation and Freezing",
            "content": "Since air has the highest moisture content at around 0°C, a film of frost forms rapidly on the evaporator, gradually thickening and obstructing airflow. Consequently, the system's efficiency is reduced, resulting in the air conditioner not heating properly due to frequent defrost cycles to melt the frost.",

            "content": "As mentioned, the highest risk for freezing the evaporator occurs when the air temperature is around 0°C, especially when there is high humidity or fog. Under these conditions, the air has a higher moisture percentage, which means that a frost film will quickly form on the outdoor unit. The least favorable operating conditions for the air conditioner are temperatures around 0°C and foggy conditions, which can lead to complete blockage of the evaporator with frost.",

            "title": "Defrosting and Reduced Efficiency",
            "content": "To prevent overload from frost, air conditioners have a built-in defrosting process, but this is not always sufficient if conditions remain persistently unfavorable. When frost appears, the system must halt operation to defrost, which can result in short interruptions and reduced heating efficiency.",

            "content": "This phenomenon should not be considered a malfunction of the air conditioner, but rather a consequence of the external weather conditions. Air conditioners are designed to operate within a certain temperature range, and when the temperature and humidity of the outdoor air exceed those limits, especially around 0°C, these problems may occur.",

        ],
        "action_steps": "Check the outdoor air temperature. Clean the filters and check for any obstructions to the fan. Perform a manual defrost if the air conditioner has too much frost on the outdoor unit by switching to cooling mode for just 5–10 minutes. Contact service if the problems persist. Regular inspection and maintenance of the air conditioner can prevent these issues and keep the unit in optimal condition.",
        "conclusion": "The efficiency of air conditioners in heating depends significantly on external weather conditions, and in conditions of low temperatures and high humidity, freezing of the evaporator can occur, reducing the heating capacity. This is not a result of a malfunction in the device, but a normal technological issue related to the specific operating conditions, meaning that the efficient operation of the air conditioner largely depends on the external weather.",
