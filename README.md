You don’t have to touch every single URL in your products array, nor manually bump a version string each time. Instead, just append a single “cache-busting” query param at render time. Here’s how to do it in one place in your CategoryComponent:

Add a single assetHash field and helper
In category.component.ts, inside your CategoryComponent class, add:

ts
Copy
Edit
// at the top of the class
assetHash = Date.now();

getImageUrl(path: string): string {
  return `${path}?v=${this.assetHash}`;
}
You can initialize assetHash in the field declaration (as above) or inside ngOnInit(), it just needs to be one value per page load.

Use it in your template
In category.component.html, wherever you do:

html
Copy
Edit
<img mat-card-image
     [src]="product.currentPicture || product.picture"
     alt="{{product.name}}">
replace it with:

html
Copy
Edit
<img mat-card-image
     [src]="getImageUrl(product.currentPicture || product.picture)"
     alt="{{product.name}}">
That’s it.

Why this works
One change: You only modify your component class and its template—no need to rewrite your entire products array.

Daily updates: Because assetHash uses Date.now(), every time you deploy (and users load the page), they’ll get a fresh timestamp. Browsers will see ?v=1612345678901 vs ?v=1612345689000 as different URLs and always fetch the newest image.

Minimal configuration: No build or server config changes needed. You’ve effectively turned cache-busting on for this component alone.

          </mat-card-footer>
        </mat-card-content>
      </mat-card> this is the html

Add a one-line helper in your component and then wrap your <img> src binding in it. You’ll never have to touch your products array again, and every page-load (and thus every new deploy) will bust the cache.

1) In category.component.ts, inside your CategoryComponent class:
ts
Copy
Edit
export class CategoryComponent implements OnInit {
  // … existing fields …

  // single timestamp per page-load
  private assetHash = Date.now();

  /** Append cache-bust query param */
  getImageUrl(path: string): string {
    return `${path}?v=${this.assetHash}`;
  }

  // … rest of your class …
}
2) In category.component.html, change only the <img> line:
html
Copy
Edit
<mat-card *ngFor="let product of displayedProducts"
          class="product-card"
          [ngStyle]="{'--hover-bg-color': product.backgroundColorproduct}"
          (click)="onNavigate('product', product.id)"
          (mouseover)="onHover(product, true)"
          (mouseout)="onHover(product, false)">
  <!-- cache-busted img -->
  <img class="product-image" mat-card-image
       [src]="getImageUrl(product.currentPicture || product.picture)"
       alt="Product Image"
       loading="lazy">
  <mat-card-content>
    <h2 class="product-name">{{ product.name }}</h2>
    <mat-card-footer class="mat-card-footer">
      <a (click)="onNavigate('product', product.id)"
         class="learn-more-btn">
        {{ larnmoreTranslations.learnmore }}
      </a>
    </mat-card-footer>
  </mat-card-content>
</mat-card>
How it works
assetHash = Date.now() gives a fresh number on each page load.

getImageUrl(...) appends ?v=… to every image URL once, at render time.

Browsers see a different URL (e.g. photo.png?v=1587654321000 vs photo.png?v=1587659999000) and always request the newest file.

No more manual version bumps or per-URL edits—just deploy your new images and users will instantly get them.







You said:
so this forces the browsers to re load all the images everytime?


ChatGPT said:

Thought for 6 seconds
Exactly—because assetHash = Date.now() is new on every page-load (and on every fresh instantiation of the CategoryComponent), every <img> URL gets a different ?v=… suffix, so the browser treats it as a brand-new resource and always fetches it rather than using its cache.

If you’d rather let browsers cache during a user’s session and only bust when you’ve actually updated images, swap out Date.now() for a static “version” you control—say, an assetVersion in your environment file that you bump whenever you deploy new pictures. That way:

Browsers will cache aggressively between version bumps.

As soon as you increment assetVersion, everyone gets fresh assets on their next visit.

Let me know if you’d like a quick example of that alternative!

Right now, with

ts
Copy
Edit
private assetHash = Date.now();
getImageUrl(path: string) {
  return `${path}?v=${this.assetHash}`;
}
every time the component is instantiated (i.e. each page-load), assetHash is a brand new millisecond timestamp—and every <img> URL is different, so the browser will fetch them all again.

Only bust when you change images
If you’d rather let the browser cache normally between your deployments, and only force a reload when you’ve updated something, swap out Date.now() for a static version string that you control:

In src/environments/environment.ts and environment.prod.ts add:

ts
Copy
Edit
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  assetVersion: '1.0.0',  // ← bump this when you update images
};
In category.component.ts:

ts
Copy
Edit
import { environment } from 'src/environments/environment';

export class CategoryComponent implements OnInit {
  // now a static, deploy-controlled version:
  private assetHash = environment.assetVersion;

  getImageUrl(path: string): string {
    return `${path}?v=${this.assetHash}`;
  }
  // …
}
In category.component.html (same as before):

html
Copy
Edit
<img mat-card-image
     [src]="getImageUrl(product.currentPicture || product.picture)"
     alt="Product Image"
     loading="lazy">
Now every browser will cache those URLs indefinitely until you bump assetVersion (e.g. to '1.0.1'), at which point they’ll see ?v=1.0.1 and fetch the new images.

Other alternatives
Angular CLI output hashing (outputHashing: "all" in angular.json) will rename your built JS/CSS (and imported assets) with a content hash, but won’t touch files you place manually in /assets.

Automatic file fingerprinting via a build script (e.g. Gulp/webpack) can rename your images themselves, if you’d rather not use query strings.

Pick whichever fits your workflow best!







You said:
i just rather keep it like that i do not care for load speed 


ChatGPT said:
Exactly—using Date.now() means every time Angular constructs your component, assetHash is brand new, so every image URL looks “new” and the browser always re-fetches it.

If you’re okay with that trade-off (instant updates at the cost of cache misses), you can leave it exactly as is. No further changes are needed.







You said:
ill keep this for a major update im gonna be having 


ChatGPT said:
That sounds like a solid plan. By sticking with the Date.now() cache-bust during day-to-day work and switching to a controlled assetVersion bump for your big release, you’ll get instant updates now and leverage caching when it really matters.

When you’re ready to prep that major update, just:

Increment the assetVersion in your environment files.

Redeploy — and the browser will fetch only the new images.

Let me know if you’d like a hand automating that bump or tweaking any build/server settings for the release!



good for next update
